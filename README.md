## Project Overview
This project is a mini-core banking system designed to manage customers, accounts, and financial transactions.
It demonstrates practical SQL usage for analyzing banking data, performing account management, and detecting high-value or suspicious transactions. 
Ideal for understanding database relationships and querying techniques in a banking context.
